# Recovery_Period_Prediction_for_Orthopedic_Patients

Orthopedic injuries are common among people of all age groups and can significantly impact daily activities. Recovery from such injuries requires a considerable amount of patience, dedication, and appropriate medical care, as it can be a lengthy and challenging process. In this study, we present a method for predicting the duration of recovery for patients with orthopedic injuries. Our approach utilizes various clinical parameters, including age, gender, type of injury, and relevant medical data, and employs machine learning techniques for construction. Specifically, we employ an artificial neural network to forecast the healing time for orthopedic injuries. The effectiveness of our system is evaluated using a dataset comprising real patients with orthopedic injuries.
